# personal-portfolio-website-1
This project is a practice webpage created by following guidance from a codecademy tutorial.
The purpose of creating this project was to improve my knowledge of basic html and css, along with gaining experience implementing bootstrap into a project.

Within this project are a series of pages that contain sections of information about myself.
The website is not meant as a personal CV, but purely a resource in which to practice my web design skills.
